## TO DO

- Convert all Swift code to Objective C so that Objective C developers can use this library or create a [Swift.h file.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24102104/how-can-i-import-swift-code-to-objective-c)
- Rename to something less Generic
- Split up into smaller more specific sub modules.
